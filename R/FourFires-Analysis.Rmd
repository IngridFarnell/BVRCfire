This script analyses four fires from 2018 (Shovel Lake, Nadina, Verdun, Island Lake) using Random Forest.
We are analysing if site prep, topography, and fire weather can predict fire severity (dNBR) in plantations.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(randomForest)
```

# Data
(waiting for data from Alana. It will include site prep (SP), day of burning (DOB), and fire weather)
```{r}

```
